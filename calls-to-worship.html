<h1><span class="header-section-number">Chapter 2</span> Calls to Worship</h1>
<p>God alone is the author of worship. Worship is not man’s invention, but rather the natural function of his nature as an image bearing creature (Genesis 1:26). We are worshippers; God made us for this purpose. As the first question of the Westminster Shorter Catechism teaches:</p>
<p>Q. 1. What is the chief end of man?<br />
A. Man’s chief end is to glorify God, and to enjoy Him forever.</p>
<p>The question is not, therefore, “Are we worshipping?” But, “Who are we worshipping?”</p>
<p>Our desire for worship was not lessened, but was horribly corrupted by Adam’s Fall. Subsequent to that event, it is in our depraved nature to “suppress the truth in unrighteousness,” and rebelliously worship and serve created things rather than our Creator (Romans 1:18-25). Through the gift of regneration (spiritual rebirth in Christ), man’s fellowship with God is restored, and we are able again to offer ourselves to God in true, Spiritual worship.</p>
<p>Since God is both the author and only proper object of worship, and since restoration to our creative purpose as His worshippers is the only way to experience true peace and joy, God graciously and frequently commands us in His Word to lift our minds and hearts to Him in worship.</p>
<p>These calls to worship—found everywhere in Scripture, but most especially the Psalms—are typically recited at the beginning of worship to remind us of our duty to worship God alone, to wake us up from spiritual slumber, and to refocus our minds on His character and attributes.</p>
<p>You will find here a growing collection of Scriptural calls to worship. These have been arranged by calls recited by the <a href="#from-the-fastor">pastor (or elder)</a> alone, and calls recited <a href="calls-to-worship.html#responsive-calls">responsively between pastor and people</a>.</p>

<h2>From the Pastor</h2>
<p>Sing praise to the LORD, you His godly ones, and give thanks to His holy name. For His anger is but for a moment, His favor is for a lifetime; Weeping may last for the night, but a shout of joy comes in the morning. | Psalm 30:4-5</p>
<hr />
<p>I will bless the Lord at all times;<br />
His praise shall continually be in my mouth.<br />
My soul will make its boast in the Lord;<br />
The humble will hear it and rejoice.<br />
O magnify the Lord with me,<br />
And let us exalt His name together. | Psalm 34:1-3</p>
<hr />
<p>Your lovingkindness, O Lord, extends to the heavens,<br />
Your faithfulness reaches to the skies.<br />
Your righteousness is like the mountains of God;<br />
Your judgments are like a great deep.<br />
O Lord, You preserve man and beast.<br />
How precious is Your lovingkindness, O God!<br />
And the children of men take refuge in the shadow of Your wings.<br />
They drink their fill of the abundance of Your house;<br />
And You give them to drink of the river of Your delights.<br />
For with You is the fountain of life;<br />
In Your light we see light. | Psalm 36:5-9</p>
<hr />
<p>Shout joyfully to the Lord, all the earth.<br />
Serve the Lord with gladness;<br />
Come before Him with joyful singing.<br />
Know that the Lord Himself is God;<br />
It is He who has made us, and not we ourselves;<br />
We are His people and the sheep of His pasture.<br />
Enter His gates with thanksgiving<br />
And His courts with praise.<br />
Give thanks to Him, bless His name.<br />
For the Lord is good;<br />
His lovingkindness is everlasting<br />
And His faithfulness to all generations. | Psalm 100</p>
<hr />
<p>Oh give thanks to the LORD, call upon His name; Make known His deeds among the peoples. Sing to Him, sing praises to Him; Speak of all His wonders. Glory in His holy name; Let the heart of those who seek the LORD be glad. Seek the LORD and His strength; Seek His face continually. Remember His wonders which He has done, His marvels and the judgments uttered by His mouth, O seed of Abraham, His servant, O sons of Jacob, His chosen ones! He is the LORD our God; His judgments are in all the earth. | Psalm 105:1-7</p>
<hr />
<p>Praise the Lord, all nations; Laud Him, all peoples! For His lovingkindness is great toward us, And the truth of the Lord is everlasting. Praise the Lord! | Psalm 117</p>
<hr />
<p>I long for Your salvation, O LORD, And Your law is my delight. Let my soul live that it may praise You, And let Your ordinances help me. I have gone astray like a lost sheep; seek Your servant, For I do not forget Your commandments. | Psalm 119:174-176</p>
<hr />
<p>Behold, God is my salvation, I will trust and not be afraid; for the LORD GOD is my strength and song, and He has become my salvation. | Isaiah 12:2</p>
<hr />
<p>Ho! Every one who thirsts, come to the waters; And you who have no money come, buy and eat. Come, buy wine and milk Without money and without cost. Why do you spend money for what is not bread, And your wages for what does not satisfy? Listen carefully to Me, and eat what is good, And delight yourself in abundance. Incline your ear and come to Me. Listen, that you may live; And I will make an everlasting covenant with you. | Isaiah 55:1-3</p>
<hr />
<p>Come and let us go up to the mountain of the LORD and to the house of the God of Jacob, That He may teach us about His ways and that we may walk in His paths. | Micah 4:2</p>
<hr />
<p>Oh, the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God! How unsearchable are His judgments and unfathomable His ways! For WHO HAS KNOWN THE MIND OF THE LORD, OR WHO BECAME HIS COUNSELOR? Or WHO HAS FIRST GIVEN TO HIM THAT IT MIGHT BE PAID BACK TO HIM AGAIN? For from Him and through Him and to Him are all things. To Him be the glory forever. Amen. | Romans 11:33-36</p>
<hr />
<p>“Awake, sleeper, And arise from the dead, And Christ will shine on you.” | Ephesians 5:14</p>
<hr />
<p>Draw near to God and He will draw near to you. Cleanse your hands, you sinners; and purify your hearts, you double-minded. Be miserable and mourn and weep; let your laughter be turned into mourning and your joy to gloom. Humble yourselves in the presence of the Lord, and He will exalt you. | James 4:8-10</p>
<hr />
<p>God is opposed to the proud, but gives grace to the humble. Therefore humble yourselves under the mighty hand of God, that He may exalt you at the proper time. | 1 Peter 5:5-6</p>

<p>Pastor: And those who led the way were sternly telling him to be quiet; but he kept crying out all the more…</p>
<p>Congregation: “Son of David, have mercy on me!”</p>
<p>Pastor: And Jesus stopped and commanded that he be brought to Him; and when he had come near, He questioned him, “What do you want Me to do for you?” And he said…</p>
<p>Congregation: “Lord, I want to regain my sight!”</p>
<p>Pastor: And Jesus said to him, “Receive your sight; your faith has made you well.” And immediately he regained his sight, and began following Him, glorifying God; and when all the people saw it, they gave praise to God.</p>
