# Calls to Worship

God alone is the author of worship. Worship is not man's invention, but rather the natural function of his nature as an image bearing creature (Genesis 1:26). We are worshippers; God made us for this purpose. As the first question of the Westminster Shorter Catechism teaches:

Q. 1. What is the chief end of man? \
A. Man's chief end is to glorify God, and to enjoy Him forever.

The question is not, therefore, "Are we worshipping?" But, "Who are we worshipping?" 

Our desire for worship was not lessened, but was horribly corrupted by Adam's Fall. Subsequent to that event, it is in our depraved nature to "suppress the truth in unrighteousness," and rebelliously worship and serve created things rather than our Creator (Romans 1:18-25). Through the gift of regneration (spiritual rebirth in Christ), man's fellowship with God is restored, and we are able again to offer ourselves to God in true, Spiritual worship.  

Since God is both the author and only proper object of worship, and since restoration to our creative purpose as His worshippers is the only way to experience true peace and joy, God graciously and frequently commands us in His Word to lift our minds and hearts to Him in worship.

These calls to worship—found everywhere in Scripture, but most especially the Psalms—are typically recited at the beginning of worship to remind us of our duty to worship God alone, to wake us up from spiritual slumber, and to refocus our minds on His character and attributes. 

You will find here a growing collection of Scriptural calls to worship. These have been arranged by calls recited by the [pastor (or elder)](#from-the-fastor) alone, and calls recited [responsively between pastor and people](#responsive-calls).

Ho! Every one who thirsts, come to the waters; And you who have no money come, buy and eat. Come, buy wine and milk Without money and without cost.

Oh, the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God! How unsearchable are His judgments and unfathomable His ways! For WHO HAS KNOWN THE MIND OF THE LORD, OR WHO BECAME HIS COUNSELOR?

"Awake, sleeper, 
And arise from the dead, 
And Christ will shine on you." | Ephesians 5:14

Draw near to God and He will draw near to you. Cleanse your hands, you sinners; and purify your hearts, you double-minded.

God is opposed to the proud, but gives grace to the humble. Therefore humble yourselves under the mighty hand of God, that He may exalt you at the proper time. | 1 Peter 5:5-6

Congregation: "Son of David, have mercy on me!"

Congregation: "Lord, I want to regain my sight!"
