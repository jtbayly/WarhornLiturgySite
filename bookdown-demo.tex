\chapter*{Liturgy}\label{liturgy}
\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Liturgy}

This site is a resource for planning worship services, providing lists
of various elements as a quick reference. v2

The word ``liturgy'' can sound intimidating, but it is merely a
composite Greek word meaning public work or duty. In Christian use,
liturgy refers to the public service of God's people. Thus, it consists
of whatever actions we perform together to express our devotion to the
Lord.

Under the Old Covenant, God had prescribed a gracious but elaborate
service of animal sacrifices and votive offerings to be practiced in a
restricted location (the tabernacle initially, later the temple in
Jerusalem), through the mediation of the Levitical priesthood. Though
these ancient ceremonies were fulfilled and done away with in the death
of Christ, yet God has prescribed for the New Testament Church a liturgy
of her own, albeit a far simpler and less restrictive one. This New
Covenant liturgy is delineated in Acts 2:42, where we read that the
first Christians were ``continually devoting themselves to the Apostles'
teaching and to fellowship, to the breaking of bread and to prayer.''
These are the basic categories of public worship subsequent to the
coming of Christ and the pouring out of His Spirit at Pentecost.

While there are perhaps various ways of faithfully giving expression to
these simple Apostolic devotions, the Protestant Church has historically
seen fit to make use of the elements found in the menu bar. (Note: song
is a subcategory of prayer, dealt with here.) Under each category you
will find examples from Scripture and history to assist you in preparing
to lead God's people in their spiritual service of worship.

\chapter*{Calls to Worship}\label{calls-to-worship}
\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Calls to Worship}

God alone is the author of worship. Worship is not man's invention, but
rather the natural function of his nature as an image bearing creature
(Genesis 1:26). We are worshippers; God made us for this purpose. As the
first question of the Westminster Shorter Catechism teaches:

Q. 1. What is the chief end of man?\\
A. Man's chief end is to glorify God, and to enjoy Him forever.

The question is not, therefore, ``Are we worshipping?'' But, ``Who are
we worshipping?''

Our desire for worship was not lessened, but was horribly corrupted by
Adam's Fall. Subsequent to that event, it is in our depraved nature to
``suppress the truth in unrighteousness,'' and rebelliously worship and
serve created things rather than our Creator (Romans 1:18-25). Through
the gift of regneration (spiritual rebirth in Christ), man's fellowship
with God is restored, and we are able again to offer ourselves to God in
true, Spiritual worship.

Since God is both the author and only proper object of worship, and
since restoration to our creative purpose as His worshippers is the only
way to experience true peace and joy, God graciously and frequently
commands us in His Word to lift our minds and hearts to Him in worship.

These calls to worship---found everywhere in Scripture, but most
especially the Psalms---are typically recited at the beginning of
worship to remind us of our duty to worship God alone, to wake us up
from spiritual slumber, and to refocus our minds on His character and
attributes.

You will find here a growing collection of Scriptural calls to worship.
These have been arranged by calls recited by the
\protect\hyperlink{from-the-fastor}{pastor (or elder)} alone, and calls
recited \protect\hyperlink{responsive-calls}{responsively between pastor
and people}.

\section{Invocations}\label{invocations}

Merciful Father,

We come into Your presence now to praise Your holy name; To humble
ourselves before Your heavenly throne and bring our sacrifices of praise
before You. We ask that you would break us of our prideful, lofty
thoughts and that You would rid us of all self-righteousness as we meet
with You---the Holy God---at this hour. Cause us to give ourselves to
Your attention and not to our own.

Would you please work in our hearts by Your Holy Spirit and would you do
a mighty work this morning as we sing, read, and hear Your Word? Would
you convict us of our sin and cause us to have true faith and repentance
so that when we go out from this place we would be renewed in Your
grace?

Father, we ask that the words we say and the thoughts of our hearts
would be acceptable in Your sight---You who are our Rock and our
Redeemer. In the name of Your dear son Jesus we pray. Amen.

Philip J. Moyer

\begin{center}\rule{0.5\linewidth}{\linethickness}\end{center}

Heavenly Father,

We are gathered here in Your presence to worship Your holy name.

You know our frame. You know our hearts. You know that we are but dust
and that we have nothing to offer you, but to humble ourselves before
Your awesome throne.

Father, by Your Holy Spirit, through the blood of Your Son Jesus Christ,
would you put a right spirit within us this morning as bring our
sacrifices of praise to You? You have said in Your word that whoever
calls upon the name of the Lord will be saved. And we call upon Your
name this morning---believing---having confidence that you will be
faithful to Your word. Have mercy on us, we pray. And may you receive
all honor and glory now and forever.

Amen.

\{For use during services when the Lord's Supper will be served\}

Heavenly Father, Maker of heaven and earth,

You are our only help and we can do nothing apart from your grace. Would
you please condescend to us this morning? Please be kind to meet with us
and show Yourself all-glorious. Please be with the singing, the reading,
the preaching of Your word, and be with us as we give offerings to you.
Strengthen us by Your meal as we celebrate the Lord's Supper together
and increase our faith in You this morning.

Lord, give us your Spirit so that we may worship you aright. Look on us
with favor as we give You the glory that is due Your name. Please take
our filthy rags, our humble sacrifices of praise, and make them pure and
beautiful in Your sight. May You receive all the glory this morning as
we worship You.

In the name of Your dear Son, Jesus we pray. Amen.

Heavenly Father, We have just confessed our faith in You and the path

we pray that You would make us not only confessors by mouth, but make
our hearts and our actions to agree with these truths we have just

Now, we pray, heavenly Father, that You would strengthen us through the

\section{Communion}\label{communion}

Father God, we give you praise that your Son, Jesus Christ, was obedient
to death, even death on the cross; and we confess that, therefore, He is
highly exalted and is given a name that is above every name; that at the
name of Jesus, every knee should bow and every tongue confess, `He is
Lord,' to the glory of God the Father.

Father, meet us at this table. Would you please send your Spirit to
strengthen the weak, to give faith to the doubting, to give forgiveness
to the bitter, to give purity to the lustful, to give charity to the
greedy? Father, give us whatever we need, that through this Body and
Blood--broken and shed for us--we might go forth from this place
cleansed through your grace.

O Lamb of God, that takes away the sins of the world, have mercy on us.

In Jesus' name, Amen.

\chapter{Confessions of Sin}\label{confessions-of-sin}

Transported by a vision into the throne room of God, the prophet Isaiah
was compelled by the heavenly sight to cry out, ``Woe is me, for I am
ruined! Because I am a man of unclean lips, and I live among a people of
unclean lips; For my eyes have seen the King, the LORD of hosts''
(Isaiah 6:5).

Confession of sin should likewise be our first and most natural response
when coming before our holy God in worship. The Scriptures teach that
``If we say that we have no sin, we are deceiving ourselves and the
truth is not in us.'' Moreover, we are assured that ``If we confess our
sins, {[}God{]} is faithful and righteous to forgive us our sins and to
cleanse us from all unrighteousness'' (1John 1:8-9). To confess our sins
corporately to God, therefore, is to demonstrate faith in His
willingness to forgive, and---when followed by an assurance of God's
pardon---to experience His glorious Gospel at work in our midst.

Here are some prayers of confession from Scripture and history to help
guide you in the work of confession.

\section{Scriptural}\label{scriptural}

O my God, I am ashamed and embarrassed to lift up my face to You, my
God, for our iniquities have risen above our heads and our guilt has
grown even to the heavens. Since the days of our fathers to this day we
have been in great guilt, and on account of our iniquities we, our kings
and our priests have been given into the hand of the kings of the lands,
to the sword, to captivity and to plunder and to open shame, as it is
this day. But now for a brief moment grace has been shown from the LORD
our God, to leave us an escaped remnant and to give us a peg in His holy
place, that our God may enlighten our eyes and grant us a little
reviving in our bondage. For we are slaves; yet in our bondage our God
has not forsaken us, but has extended lovingkindness to us in the sight
of the kings of Persia, to give us reviving to raise up the house of our
God, to restore its ruins and to give us a wall in Judah and Jerusalem.
Now, our God, what shall we say after this? For we have forsaken Your
commandments, which You have commanded by Your servants the prophets,
saying, `The land which you are entering to possess is an unclean land
with the uncleanness of the peoples of the lands, with their
abominations which have filled it from end to end and with their
impurity. So now do not give your daughters to their sons nor take their
daughters to your sons, and never seek their peace or their prosperity,
that you may be strong and eat the good things of the land and leave it
as an inheritance to your sons forever.' After all that has come upon us
for our evil deeds and our great guilt, since You our God have requited
us less than our iniquities deserve, and have given us an escaped
remnant as this, shall we again break Your commandments and intermarry
with the peoples who commit these abominations? Would You not be angry
with us to the point of destruction, until there is no remnant nor any
who escape? O LORD God of Israel, You are righteous, for we have been
left an escaped remnant, as it is this day; behold, we are before You in
our guilt, for no one can stand before You because of this. \textbar{}
Ezra 9:6-15

\begin{center}\rule{0.5\linewidth}{\linethickness}\end{center}

Alas, O Lord, the great and awesome God, who keeps His covenant and
lovingkindness for those who love Him and keep His commandments, we have
sinned, committed iniquity, acted wickedly and rebelled, even turning
aside from Your commandments and ordinances. Moreover, we have not
listened to Your servants the prophets, who spoke in Your name to our
kings, our princes, our fathers and all the people of the land.
Righteousness belongs to You, O Lord, but to us open shame, as it is
this day--to the men of Judah, the inhabitants of Jerusalem and all
Israel, those who are nearby and those who are far away in all the
countries to which You have driven them, because of their unfaithful
deeds which they have committed against You. Open shame belongs to us, O
Lord, to our kings, our princes and our fathers, because we have sinned
against You. To the Lord our God belong compassion and forgiveness, for
we have rebelled against Him; nor have we obeyed the voice of the LORD
our God, to walk in His teachings which He set before us through His
servants the prophets. Indeed all Israel has transgressed Your law and
turned aside, not obeying Your voice; so the curse has been poured out
on us, along with the oath which is written in the law of Moses the
servant of God, for we have sinned against Him. Thus He has confirmed
His words which He had spoken against us and against our rulers who
ruled us, to bring on us great calamity; for under the whole heaven
there has not been done anything like what was done to Jerusalem. As it
is written in the law of Moses, all this calamity has come on us; yet we
have not sought the favor of the LORD our God by turning from our
iniquity and giving attention to Your truth. Therefore the LORD has kept
the calamity in store and brought it on us; for the LORD our God is
righteous with respect to all His deeds which He has done, but we have
not obeyed His voice. And now, O Lord our God, who have brought Your
people out of the land of Egypt with a mighty hand and have made a name
for Yourself, as it is this day--we have sinned, we have been wicked. O
Lord, in accordance with all Your righteous acts, let now Your anger and
Your wrath turn away from Your city Jerusalem, Your holy mountain; for
because of our sins and the iniquities of our fathers, Jerusalem and
Your people have become a reproach to all those around us. So now, our
God, listen to the prayer of Your servant and to his supplications, and
for Your sake, O Lord, let Your face shine on Your desolate sanctuary. O
my God, incline Your ear and hear! Open Your eyes and see our
desolations and the city which is called by Your name; for we are not
presenting our supplications before You on account of any merits of our
own, but on account of Your great compassion. O Lord, hear! O Lord,
forgive! O Lord, listen and take action! For Your own sake, O my God, do
not delay, because Your city and Your people are called by Your name.

\section{Traditional}\label{traditional}

ALMIGHTY and most merciful Father; we have erred, and strayed from thy
ways like lost sheep. We have followed too much the devices and desires
of our own hearts. We have offended against thy holy laws. We have left
undone those things which we ought to have done; and we have done those
things which we ought not to have done; and there is no health in us.
But thou, O Lord, have mercy upon us, miserable offenders. Spare thou
them, O God, who confess their faults. Restore thou those who are
penitent; According to thy promises declared unto mankind in Christ
Jesus our Lord. And grant, O most merciful Father, for his sake; That we
may hereafter live a godly, righteous, and sober life, To the glory of
thy holy Name. Amen.

1549 Book of Common Prayer

\begin{center}\rule{0.5\linewidth}{\linethickness}\end{center}

Lord God, eternal and almighty Father: We acknowledge before your holy
majesty that we are poor sinners, conceived and born in guilt and in
corruption, prone to do evil, unable of our own power to do good.
Because of our sin, we endlessly violate your holy commandments. But, O
Lord, with heartfelt sorrow we repent and turn away from all our
offenses. We condemn ourselves and our evil ways, with true sorrow
asking that your grace will relieve our distress. Have compassion on us,
most gracious God, Father of mercies, for the sake of your son Jesus
Christ our Lord. And in removing our guilt, also grant us daily increase
of the grace of your Holy Spirit, and produce in us the fruits of
holiness and of righteousness pleasing in your sight: Through Jesus
Christ our Lord. Amen.

Adapted from John Calvin's Geneva Liturgy of 1543

\begin{center}\rule{0.5\linewidth}{\linethickness}\end{center}

Almighty God, we are unworthy to come into your presence, because of our
many sins. We do not deserve any grace or mercy from you, if you dealt
with us as we deserve. We have sinned against you, O Lord, and we have
offended you. And yet, O Lord, as we acknowledge our sins and offenses,
so also do we acknowledge you to be a merciful God, a loving and
favorable Father, to all who turn to you. And so we humbly ask you, for
the sake of Christ your son, to show mercy to us, and forgive us all our
offenses. Forgive the sins of our youth, and the sins of our old age. By
your Spirit, O God, take possession of our hearts, so that, not only the
actions of our life, but also the words of our mouths, and the smallest
thought of our minds, may be guided and governed by you. Through Jesus
Christ our Lord, to whom, with you and the Holy Spirit, be all honor and
glory, now and forever. Amen.

Heavenly Father,

It is our privilege to confess our sins before You because You have
promised in Your Word that if we confess our sins, You are faithful to
cleanse us from all unrighteousness through the blood of Jesus Christ,
and that we will receive the promise of eternal life.

Father, we have sinned, and we ask that you would please forgive us for
how we have broken Your perfect and Holy Law. Forgive us for running
away from You and turning our backs on You.

Like sheep we have gone astray and have turned to our own ways. We have
turned to our own earthly desires---to our own flesh, and in doing so we
have turned to strange flesh. We have turned to other gods and we have
sinned against You. We have done unlawful things in Your sight. Father,
please forgive us and renew us in Your grace.

We pray in Jesus name, Amen.

Philip J. Moyer

Heavenly Father, Merciful Father,

We come before you now as a people who are heavy with sin. Our sins
weigh us down and we are unable to help ourselves. We confess that we
have not turned to You in our distress. We have not called upon Your
name in times of trouble, but rather in our wickedness we have sought to
drive you away because of our shame. We have deceived ourselves seeking
to be rescued by pleasures and entertainments rather than coming before
You, the holy God, to cry to You for help and to have our prayers
answered.

We have sinned thinking that we can fix ourselves. We are guilty of
clinging to the very sins for which Your Son, Jesus Christ, died on the
cross. Forgive us for our pride and for not bringing our burdens to You,
thinking that they are not too heavy for us to bear.

Father we cannot bear the awful load of our sin. So please, heavenly
Father, by the blood of Your Son Jesus Christ, remove from us this
burden and save us. Restore to us the joy of Your salvation and renew a
right spirit within us.

Father, You are our only Helper; our only Redeemer; the only One who can
save.

Lord, hear our prayers and deliver us this day so that we would no
longer be slaves to sin, but that we would be set free to dwell in Your
peaceful Kingdom.

We ask in the powerful Name of our Savior Jesus Christ. Amen.

Prayer of Confession for Pentecost

\{After singing Come, Thou Almighty King\}

Gracious Heavenly Father,

We know that You have promised Your Holy Spirit to all who trust in You.
We have just asked the Holy Spirit to rule in each of our hearts and to
never depart from us. Yet, we confess that we have sinned in many ways
against You and Your Spirit, and have behaved as if He does not live in
our hearts.

When you have healed us from sickness, we have attributed our healing to
earthly things and we have not acknowledged You for the miracles You
have done.

When you have given us gifts, we have refused to be content or thankful
for your mercies to us and have instead envied your gifts to others.

We are an ungrateful people.

When you have touched our lips with your Holy Spirit, we have shut our
mouths so that we would not have to bear the reproach of the words that
we would say.

When you have spoken to us, we have shut our ears, afraid of what You
might call us to do. You have given us Your Word, yet we have refused to
walk in it. We have persisted in willful sin and have not repented.

We are a disobedient people.

In these ways, and many others, we have sinned against Your Holy Spirit
and we ask that You would please forgive us, O heavenly Father, for how
we have quenched Your Holy Spirit.

We pray that you would restore to us the joy of Your salvation and renew
a right spirit within us. We repent of our sin. And we, as Your covenant
people, trust in the promises You have made to us---having faith in
Christ's provision and believing the power of the Holy Spirit to heal us
and give us the ability to obey.

Renew our hearts, we pray.

In the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, Amen.

Philip J. Moyer
